# PUB_SSHMATE
### This is a tool designed for admins to run commands on one or more devices. This tool is useful if you support Cisco and need to run commands on a regular basis on you devices. You setup a batch file that will run the tool as many times as needed. Use the "-shell" argument to enter commands in the same shell instead of reconnecting to the device or server for each command.
